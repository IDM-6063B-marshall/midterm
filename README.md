I want to illustrate a cover for [Piranesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranesi_(novel)), by Susanna Clarke. In the novel, the narrator lives alone an enormous house full of statues with a grand staircase. The lower halls of the house are flooded and the world of the house is so huge that the narrator experiences tides.
I’d like to depict the main hall and staircase as static shapes with tides going in and out, with maybe some smaller lapping of waves and one big swell. It would be cool to achieve a color gradient of some kind. I think this will mostly be time-based. I want to use sin/cos or other methods to create movement that loops instead of resetting. Other ideas are have are to use images to create the background in a more collage-y way or to include birds (another major plot element) flying in and out.
Thematically I think this project reminds me the most of the readings on interactivity. Even though I plan to do a time-based animation there’s a theme throughout the novel about the relationship the world/our real world and the house where the narrative lives and how each is responsive to the other.
